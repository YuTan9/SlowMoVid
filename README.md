# SlowMoVid
> Play a video at selected speed and fine tune frames

## Purpose
The existing video players on Android phone rely on delicate swiping actions, and the 
author doesn't have a pair of dexerous hands. This app aims to make it easier for 
fat-finger-fellows to be able to easily jump from frame to frame.

## Features
1. Select videos on the phone.
2. Play video at selected speed. (Adjust with the slidebar at the bottom of the screen)
3. Jump to next / previous frame.
4. Long press to keep jumping to next / previous frame.
5. Draw on the video for reference.
